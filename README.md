# Sofs Breaks Blocks

This is my first game using [Ruby 2D](https://www.ruby2d.com/) lib!

## How to Play

Run the executable that is at the `build` dir.

```
$ .\build\app
```

Use the following keys:

* Arrow `left` and `right` to move
* `Space` to shoot
* `Esc` to close the game

## Development

You will need a **Ruby** environment that can build native extensions and the Ruby 2D gem.

```
$ gem install ruby2d
```

And [Rake](https://github.com/ruby/rake) to run the build task.

```
$ gem install rake
```

And to run the app:

```
$ ruby main.rb
```

### Build

This build task

```
$ rake build
```

## TO DO

- Game over
- Add the points system and a scorebar
- Surprise blocks
- New weapons with different kind shots
- Sounds?
